<br>

The Coding Drone (BRC-105) is the world's first drone for coding education capable of unplugged coding.<br>
By mounting a color sensor on the bottom of the drone, unplugged coding can be done with a coding card composed of 8 colors.<br>
In addition, not only unplugged coding, but also coding activities with Entry and Python by connecting to a PC are possible. <br>
As such, Coding Drone is designed to provide various coding methods so that you can easily enjoy drone coding anytime, anywhere.<Br>


Through this lecture,
1. You can learn the basic concepts of coding through various types of coding activities.
2. You can directly experience the autonomous flight of the coding drone.
3. By combining coding and drones, which are the core fields of the 4th industry, you can develop integrated & convergence thinking skills required for STEAM education.
4. You can develop the capabilities of creative convergence talents that are essential for the future society.

<h2>1. Charging the battery</h2>

Learn how to charge your battery. Be sure to charge the battery using a dedicated charger and use a fully charged battery.
<br>

<div align="center">
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="center">
                    <img src="images/image11.jpg">
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="left">
                1) Connect the dedicated charger to a device that can be charged (chargeable adapter, PC, etc.).<br>
                2) In charging standby mode, the LED on the charger blinks red.<br>
                3) Insert the battery to be charged into the charger according to the direction of the connector.<br>
                4) The charging status is judged by the LED light of the charger.<br>
                    ① Charging: LED lights red.<br>
                    ② Charging complete: The LED light turns off.<br>
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<br>
<font color="red"><b>※It takes about 60 minutes to complete charging, and the drone can fly for about 8 minutes on a charged battery. Flight times may vary depending on the surrounding environment (eg temperature, wind, etc.).</b></font>

<br>

<h2>2. Installing the battery</h2>

To install batteries on the drone and remote controller, follow these steps.

<div align="center">
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="center">

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="center">
                    <img src="images/image12.jpeg">
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>
                <div align="center">
                    <img src="images/image13.jpeg">
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="left">
                Insert the battery by pushing it into the battery frame on the back of the drone with the connector part facing down. 
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>
                <div align="left">
                The remote controller uses 2 AA size batteries as batteries. Open the battery cap on the back of the remote controller and insert one by one according to the polarity direction.
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<br>

<font color="red"><b>※ What if the battery runs out?!</b></font>

<br>

<div align="center">
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">
                <div align="center">
                    <img src="images/image14.jpeg">

            </td>
            <td>
                <div align="left">
                If the drone's battery is discharged during flight, the main LED blinks with a buzzer sound and the remote controller vibrates continuously. <br>
                In this case, immediately land the drone and replace the discharged battery with a fully charged battery.
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <div align="left">
                [Battery charge time = <font color="blue"><b>about 60 minutes</b></font> / Flight time (on one full charge) = <font color="blue"><b>about 8 minutes</b></font>]
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h2>3. Reset and pair</h2>

Try pairing the drone with the remote controller. <br>
Coding drones are maintained once paired, but if pairing is lost for some reason or you need to pair with another drone or remote controller, you need to pair them again after resetting.<br>

<br>
<div align="center">
    <img src="images/image15.jpg">
</div>

<br>

<h2>4. Precautions for use</h2>

<br>
1) Before flying the drone, make sure that there are no people or obstacles around it, and secure a safe distance before flying.<br>
2) When the battery runs out, it lands immediately and replaces it with a fully charged battery.<br>
3) Always install the latest firmware.<br>
- [Download firmware program ](http://dev.byrobot.co.kr/documents/kr/products/coding_drone/log/updates/firmware/)<br>
- [Firmware Update Manual ](http://dev.byrobot.co.kr/documents/kr/products/coding_drone/manual/update/drone4autoupdaterlight/)<br>
4) Be careful as applying severe impact to the drone and remote controller may cause malfunction.<br><br>
